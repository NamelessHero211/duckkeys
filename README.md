# Duck Keys

An Android keyboard with six original squeaks, including a high-pitched rubber dog toy, plus a random sound option.

[Download Duck Keys 1.2](https://github.com/NamelessHero211/duckkeys/raw/refs/heads/main/DuckKeys-1.2.apk)

Requires Android 8.0 or later. Install the APK, open Duck Keys, then enable and select its keyboard using the two setup buttons.

## Updates

Version 1.2 adds automatic update checks and downloads. Open it once after installation to schedule periodic background checks. Checks also run when opening the app if the previous attempt was more than six hours ago. Android controls the timing of background work.

Enable update notifications in the app to be alerted when an update has downloaded. Open Duck Keys and tap **Install downloaded update**, then approve Android's installation prompt. On the first update, Android may ask you to allow Duck Keys to install its updates.

Automatic downloads can be turned off. **Check for updates now** remains available for manual checks inside the app.

The update channel is [update.json](update.json). Downloads must use HTTPS, match the published SHA-256 checksum, have the correct package name and a higher version code, and use the same signing certificate as the installed app. The signing key is not stored in this repository.

## Privacy

No ads, analytics, or typing history. Internet access is used only for update metadata and APK downloads from GitHub. Typed text is never sent to the update server. GitHub receives normal update download requests.

## Publishing a future version

1. Build and sign with the original Duck Keys signing key. Increase the manifest version code.
2. Upload the newly named APK to this repository.
3. Update `update.json` with its version code, version name, HTTPS raw download URL, and lowercase SHA-256 checksum.
4. Publish the manifest only after its APK is available. Existing installations will find it on their next successful check.

Build, package alignment, and APK signatures have been verified. Physical-device and emulator testing have not been performed in the creation workspace.
